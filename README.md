# BFS-and-DFS-traversal


Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm could be implemented with Queue data structure. Breadth First Search is completely suitable for finding shortest paths like in Dijkstra Algorithm.

  Time complexity of BFS: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

Depth First Search  (DFS)  algorithm could be implemented with Stack data structure.

  Time complexity of DFS: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
